# Swiss-Energy-Analytics-Forecasting-2025-

1. 📚 Background & Overview
This end-to-end project analyzes, visualizes, and forecasts energy production and consumption in Switzerland using real-world grid data from Swissgrid. The aim is to generate deep insights into how electricity is used, exchanged, and balanced across the country — and to build predictive models that support operational planning and energy forecasting.

The project combines:

📊 Data wrangling & exploratory analysis (Python, Pandas)

🧠 Machine learning models for short-term energy forecasting (Random Forest & XGBoost)

📈 Visual storytelling in Power BI

🌍 Canton-level energy insights and national trends

🔮 Future forecasting for hourly consumption through December 2025
